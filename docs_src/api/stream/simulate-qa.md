# simulate_qa

Simulate a time-ordered question and answer session.

This method allows looping through a dataset in the order in which it arrived. Indeed, it usually is the case that labels arrive after features. Being able to go through a dataset in arrival order enables assessing a model's performance in a reliable manner. For instance, the `evaluate.progressive_val_score` is a high-level method that can be used to score a model on a dataset. Under the hood it uses this method to determine the correct arrival order.

## Parameters

- **dataset** (*Iterator[Tuple[dict, Any]]*)

    A stream of (features, target) tuples.

- **moment** (*Union[str, Callable]*)

    The attribute used for measuring time. If a callable is passed, then it is expected to take as input a `dict` of features. If `None`, then the observations are implicitly timestamped in the order in which they arrive. If a `str` is passed, then it will be used to obtain the time from the input features.

- **delay** (*Union[str, int, datetime.timedelta, Callable]*)

    The amount of time to wait before revealing the target associated with each observation to the model. This value is expected to be able to sum with the `moment` value. For instance, if `moment` is a `datetime.date`, then `delay` is expected to be a `datetime.timedelta`. If a callable is passed, then it is expected to take as input a `dict` of features and the target. If a `str` is passed, then it will be used to access the relevant field from the features. If `None` is passed, then no delay will be used, which leads to doing standard online validation. If a scalar is passed, such an `int` or a `datetime.timedelta`, then the delay is constant.

- **copy** (*bool*) â€“ defaults to `True`

    If `True`, then a separate copy of the features are yielded the second time around. This ensures that inadvertent modifications in downstream code don't have any effect.



## Examples

The arrival delay isn't usually indicated in a dataset, but it might be able to be inferred
from the features. As an example, we'll simulate the departure and arrival time of taxi
trips. Let's first create a time table which records the departure time and the duration of
seconds of several taxi trips.

```python
>>> import datetime as dt
>>> time_table = [
...     (dt.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 20,  0, 0),  900),
...     (dt.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 20, 10, 0), 1800),
...     (dt.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 20, 20, 0),  300),
...     (dt.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 20, 45, 0),  400),
...     (dt.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 20, 50, 0),  240),
...     (dt.datetime(2020, 1, 1, 20, 55, 0),  450)
... ]

```

We can now create a streaming dataset where the features are the departure dates and the
targets are the durations.

```python
>>> dataset = (
...     ({'date': date}, duration)
...     for date, duration in time_table
... )

```

Now, we can use `simulate_qa` to iterate over the events in the order in which they are
meant to occur.

```python
>>> delay = lambda _, y: dt.timedelta(seconds=y)

>>> for i, x, y in simulate_qa(dataset, moment='date', delay=delay):
...     if y is None:
...         print(f'{x["date"]} - trip #{i} departs')
...     else:
...         arrival_date = x['date'] + dt.timedelta(seconds=y)
...         print(f'{arrival_date} - trip #{i} arrives after {y} seconds')
2020-01-01 20:00:00 - trip #0 departs
2020-01-01 20:10:00 - trip #1 departs
2020-01-01 20:15:00 - trip #0 arrives after 900 seconds
2020-01-01 20:20:00 - trip #2 departs
2020-01-01 20:25:00 - trip #2 arrives after 300 seconds
2020-01-01 20:40:00 - trip #1 arrives after 1800 seconds
2020-01-01 20:45:00 - trip #3 departs
2020-01-01 20:50:00 - trip #4 departs
2020-01-01 20:51:40 - trip #3 arrives after 400 seconds
2020-01-01 20:54:00 - trip #4 arrives after 240 seconds
2020-01-01 20:55:00 - trip #5 departs
2020-01-01 21:02:30 - trip #5 arrives after 450 seconds

```

This function is extremely practical because it provides a reliable way to evaluate the
performance of a model in a real scenario. Indeed, it allows to make predictions and
perform model updates in exactly the same manner that would happen live. For instance, it
is used in `evaluate.progressive_val_score`, which is a higher level function for
evaluating models in an online manner.
